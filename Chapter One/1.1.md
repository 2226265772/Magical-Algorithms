# Bucket Sort

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;**Bucket sort**, or **bin sort**, is a [sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) that works by distributing the elements of an [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) into a number of [buckets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_(computing)). Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a [distribution sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Distribution_sort), a generalization of [pigeonhole sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_sort), and is a cousin of [radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort) in the most-to-least significant digit flavor. Bucket sort can be implemented with comparisons and therefore can also be considered a [comparison sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort) algorithm. The [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) depends on the algorithm used to sort each bucket, the number of buckets to use, and whether the input is uniformly distributed. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort)

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The above paragraph is from Wikipedia, but I think it is difficult for many people to understand. That is a very official and rigid introduction. So let me simplify it!

----------

In the world we live in, there are things that are sorted everywhere. When standing in the team, they will be sorted according to their height. The ranking of the exams needs to be sorted according to the score. When shopping online, they will be sorted by price, and the emails in the email will be sorted by time.

In short, many things need to sort, it can be said that sorting is everywhere. Now let's take a concrete example to introduce the sorting algorithm.

After the final exam, the teacher will sort the students' scores from high to low. There are only 5 students in Tony's class. The 5 students scored 5 points, 3 points, 5 points, 2 points and 8 points respectively. The score is really terrible (out of 10 points). The scores are then sorted from large to small, sorted to 8 5 5 3 2 . Do you have any good way to write a program that allows the computer to randomly read 5 numbers and then output the 5 numbers from large to small? Please think about it, at least 15 minutes and then look down.

We can solve this problem with a one-dimensional array here. Please make sure you really think about it and look down.

First we need to apply an array of size 11 int a[11] OK, now you have 11 variables, numbered from a[0]~a[10]. At the beginning, we initialized a[0]~a[10] to 0, indicating that none of these scores have been obtained. For example, if a[0] is equal to 0, it means that no one has ever scored 0. Similarly, a[1] is equal to 0, which means that no one has scored 1 point yet. A[10] equals 0, which means that no one has scored 10 points yet.
