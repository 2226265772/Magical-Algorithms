# Bucket Sort

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;**Bucket sort**, or **bin sort**, is a [sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) that works by distributing the elements of an [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) into a number of [buckets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_(computing)). Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a [distribution sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Distribution_sort), a generalization of [pigeonhole sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_sort), and is a cousin of [radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort) in the most-to-least significant digit flavor. Bucket sort can be implemented with comparisons and therefore can also be considered a [comparison sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort) algorithm. The [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) depends on the algorithm used to sort each bucket, the number of buckets to use, and whether the input is uniformly distributed. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort)
