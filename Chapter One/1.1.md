# Bucket Sort

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;**Bucket sort**, or **bin sort**, is a [sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) that works by distributing the elements of an [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) into a number of [buckets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_(computing)). Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a [distribution sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Distribution_sort), a generalization of [pigeonhole sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_sort), and is a cousin of [radix sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort) in the most-to-least significant digit flavor. Bucket sort can be implemented with comparisons and therefore can also be considered a [comparison sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort) algorithm. The [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) depends on the algorithm used to sort each bucket, the number of buckets to use, and whether the input is uniformly distributed. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort)

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The above paragraph is from Wikipedia, but I think it is difficult for many people to understand. That is a very official and rigid introduction. So let me simplify it!

----------

In the world we live in, there are things that are sorted everywhere. When standing in the team, they will be sorted according to their height. The ranking of the exams needs to be sorted according to the score. When shopping online, they will be sorted by price, and the emails in the email will be sorted by time.
